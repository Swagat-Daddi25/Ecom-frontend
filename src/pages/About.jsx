        Welcome to My Bag — where quality meets convenience. We started My Bag
        with one simple goal: to make it easier for people to find products they
        love, without compromising on quality, price, or experience. What began
        as [a small idea / a passion project / a solution to a common problem]
        has grown into an ecommerce store trusted by customers who value
        reliability and great service.
